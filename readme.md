## Interactivity && Graphics && Sound

### Due Date : October 3

### Goals:

1. See, Hear, Respond
2. Breakdown
3. Turning In
4. Read
5. Read More


#### 1. See and Hear
Combine Visual, Aural, and interactive elements. Completed projects will be projected and connected to the speaker system; unless requiring unique viewing/hearing hardware, for example: Oculus Rift, Leap Motion, etc. Completed projects can be infinitely evolving, directly responsive, performative, and so on.

Please cite/reference any code, image, sound, etc that is not yours.

#### 2. Breakdown
Before getting code dirty, draw/write out the bits and pieces of what you think you'll need. What are the components? How should they connect? Is there an order to events? 

#### 3. Turning In
1. Add a git repo to your OF folder, if one isn't there already
1. Add .gitignore
1. Add files
1. Commit files
1. Push to github
1. Fork this assignment repsitory
1. Update links.md with your repository link, this can be found clicking the "clone or download" button on the webpage of the repository you are linking in (your project)
1. Make pull request

#### 3.5 For those interested, (not required)

1. Clone your fork of this assignment repository to your computer
2. In the cloned directory add a submodule to your project's remote respository using the link from above. This can only be completed by the command line or some other Git GUI interface - not the github Desktop App.

Replace _remote-url_ with something like _git@github.com:shawnlawson/EV9D9.git_ and _linked-folder-name_ with your name _shawnlawson_

```bash
git submodule add remote-url linked-folder-name
```

3. Add files
4. Commit files

```bash
git commit -am 'adding my submodule'
```

5. Push to remote

```bash
git push
```

6. Make a pull request

#### 4. Read
In all of these, ski[p,m] the Processing parts. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 5, This one is up to you: Object Oriented Programming, Pointers, References, and Arrays. When Are You Going to Use This?  -> page 157. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 6, This one is also up to you: Review of things we've done, OF tour, IDE's, setup, debugging. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 8, Graphics, Animation, Vectors. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 9, Pixel data. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 10, Sound. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 13, This one is also up to you: 3D. Or just the shader part on pages 520 - 529.

#### 5. Read More
A few more things to read are in the google drive. We won't have time to directly talk about them, but are good to think about.
